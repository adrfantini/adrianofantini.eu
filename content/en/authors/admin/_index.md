<div align="justify";>
My name is Adriano Fantini; I was born in Belluno, Italy in 1990.
I currently live in Belluno with my partner and our daughter, born in 2010.

My academic background is physics, and I obtained a PhD in Earth Science and Fluid Dynamics in 2019 from the University of Trieste, Italy,
where I trained in climatology, hydrology and data science.  
During my academic period I especially enjoyed the technical aspects and challenges of data analysis and of the handling of large climatic simulations on High Performance Computing platforms.

After a few years as a developer and data analyst at [Higeco](https://www.higeco.com/en),
I am now Software Development Manager at [Higeco More](https://www.higecomore.com/en).  

I love mountaineering, technology, gaming, books and getting my hands dirty with stuff.  
I am one of the organisers of the amazing [Great Snowball Fight](https://gbpn.netlify.app/en).
